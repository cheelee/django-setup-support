# Auto-generated Django Single-Page Application Scaffold.

This is a generated tool. It assumes default basic (optional) support for:
1. User accounts and authentication (see auto-generated accounts app.)
1. Django REST framework for web interaction with the installed database.
1. SQLite database. Users are advised to replace this with a production database if needed.

Please update accordingly for actual tool development.

## Next Development Steps

Tool developers can use the comments marked "TODO" in the appropriate
default Django files updated by the scaffolding tool. There are also files created by
the scaffolding tool.

1. Update or clean appended structures in the project's settings.py file.
1. Update or clean appended structures in the project's urls.py file.
1. Update or clean appended structures in the accounts app's views.py file.
1. Review and clean constructs in the newly-created urls.py file in the accounts app.
